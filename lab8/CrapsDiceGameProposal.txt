Proposal Outline
1. Cover Page
Group member names = Danielle O'Neal, Jordana Simon, Emily Lakic, Samantha Chu
Project title = Craps Dice Game
Course number = CS 110 A0
Semester = Fall 2016
II. Public Interface Design
* We will be using digital wireframing as our public interface
* We will layout the design of the cards, the rules of the game and how to play
III. Top-Level Design
* Logic classes 
   * Crapsgame.py (Controls the rolling of the dice)
   * Die.py (Makes the logic of the die (Makes the sides: 1-6))
   * Rollingdie.py (Makes the dice roll, checks if the dice are rolling, avoids collisions between the dice, makes the dice move, makes the actual dots on the dice)
* Interface GUI classes
   * Craps.py (Overlaps all of the classes; main interface class)
   * CrapsStats.py (Makes GUI window, runs game, and controls wins/losses)
   * CrapsTable.py (Formats table, checks if dice are still rolling, and processes timer events)
   * Controlpanel.py (Makes the roll button and rolls the dice when the button is clicked)
IV. Tasks and Responsibilities
* A timeline of when tasks and project units will be completed
   * Think of this as a todo list with due dates you give yourself
   * Your project should be broken up into manageable units (see below)
      * A unit is not complete until it has been formally tested
* You must outline who is responsible for each task by documenting both individual and collaborative responsibility
   * Emily Lakic - Logic classes portion of the project
      * Code Rollingdie.py (independent program unit)
      * Code die.py
   * Danielle O’Neal - Interface classes portion of the project
      * Code CrapsStats.py
      * Code Controlpanel.py
   * Jordana Simon - Logic classes portion of the project
      * Code Crapsgame.py (independent program unit)
   * Samantha Chu - Interface classes portion of the project
      * Code CrapsTable.py
   * Collaboratively - Interface classes & Logic classes
      * Code Craps.py (Interface class)
V. Testing
* We will use the print function to determine if all of the variables and functions are correctly running to successfully play a dice game of Craps
* We will perform integration testing using various test inputs to test all possible cases of inputs into our Craps program
* We will test our code using the Python terminal as well as Atom
